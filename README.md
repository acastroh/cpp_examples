# cpp_examples
This is a collection of programming examples in C++.
These examples were developed in Visual Studio 2019 using the default compiler.
For simplicity to the reader, only the cpp and h files from the solution are posted.

## folder numbering

The numbers in the folder is a suggested order to review the programming examples. However, each programming example is indepedenent of the rest i.e. it does not make a reference to previous examples.

## importing to Visual Studio

To create a Visual Studio solution from each folder, follow the guide [How to: Create a C++ Project from Existing Code](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/how-to-create-a-cpp-project-from-existing-code?view=msvc-170 'How to: Create a C++ Project from Existing Code').
